# Enemy Design

I'm experiencing great difficulty at the moment designing the enemies. I know I want them to have a Utility Skill, and provide some variation on movement and attack mechanics.


## Design Rules

This checklist is to help provide a scope of reality and limitation for designing enemies. If I can't narrow down what they are, I shall start with they can and cannot be.

* Cannot be Humans
    * Tilts the game more to horror
    * Would require a more thorough written narrative that would allow it, otherwise it can create digestive friction.
* Cannot be Cute
    * Creatures we possess eventually die or decay
    * Unneccessary trauma is unneccessary
        * Main goal is Good Gameplay, not impactful narrative
* Must have a Utility Skill
    * It can be simple and shared with other enemies
* Must be able to Move or actively interact with other Enemies which can move.
    * Whatever gets possessed starts to die off, so the player must be able to reach another target.
    * Examples of when this is acceptable:
        * Player posesses a King sitting in a throne, and waits for certain target to come to them.
        * Player posesses a Plant and spawns flowers to attract Creatures to possess
* Can be Humanoid Shape
    * Orc, Goblins, Werewolves
* Can be Beast or Creature
    * Boar, Giant Spider, Dragon
* Cannot be an Innanimate Object
    * Possession must decay
    * Obstacles can obviously be inanimate objects, and provide enemy-like problems.
        * Example: Turret or Flame-Trap
* Can be Mythical
    * Greek
        * Minotaur, Centaur, Medusa/Gorgon, Harpy
    * Shinto
        * Turtle, Frog, Wolf, Serpent, Wyvern
    * Fantasy
        * Chimera, Elementals, Fairies
* Cannot be Spritis or Ghosts
    * Ghost possessing ghost is too confusing
    * Could be a cool mechanic for story-based enemy though...
* Can be limited to Terrain
    * Underwater Creatures
        * As long as player can escape water as Ghost or find new target to possess
    * Flying Creatures
* Can use Weapons
    * Can be a Class
        * Goblin Fighter, Goblin Archer, Goblin Wizard
* Can use Magic
    * Can only specialize in one point of magic though
        * Limited buttons and controls
        * Don't want to overwhelm
