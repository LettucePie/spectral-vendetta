# Spectral Vendetta

2D Hack-n-slash action game made in Godot 4. Main gimmick is the Possession mechanic. The player will be constantly jumping from enemy to enemy, using them to advance until inevitably discarding them for the next.

## Setup

- Godot 4.0.3 +
- Krita 5.1 +

Download the project and open it in Godot. Located at the top right should be a Play Button. As of right now there is no Play Scene assigned to that button, but normally that would be how to start the game from within Godot. In it's current state, I am working off of conceptual scenes and assets under the "testing" folder. You can navigate there from within Godot using the FileSystem tab. Then open one of the scenes and run the Current Scene. The button to run it should be located next to the Play Button mentioned earlier. It looks like a Movie Shutter.
